        <span>
        <p class="text"> ✨Once upon a time, I was designing cakes and baking pastries that could make anyone forget their diet.While I loved creating, I always admired the world of computers and thought programming was only for younger people. I never imagined I could learn anything beyond Microsoft Office.
                        One day, while watching others code, I felt a mix of admiration and a little jealousy — until my son said: “If you love it, why not try, no matter your age? You must follow your dreams.” That was the push I needed.

                        Since then, I’ve dived into programming and, over the past year and a half, completed a full-stack development course. Today, I combine creativity, design, and coding to build user-friendly websites. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, and I’m always learning more.

                        I bring the precision of a baker, the creativity of a designer, and the problem-solving mindset of a developer. Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect UIs or building responsive, functional apps, I’m ready to turn ideas into something people can actually use — and enjoy.
