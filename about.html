        <span>
        <p class="text"> ✨Once upon a time, I was designing cakes and baking pastries that could make anyone forget their diet. Life was sweet — literally.But one day, I saw a woman sitting in a café, working on her laptop, 
            and I thought: <em>“I wish I could be like her.”</em> From that moment, I decided to run after my dream.
            From that moment, it felt like every programmer in the world was chasing me, whispering: “Come on, woman, this is your world!” So I jumped in.
            One and a half years later, I’ve completed a full-stack development course and now I’m mixing creativity, design, and code to build user-friendly websites. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js — and I’m always learning more.
            I bring the precision of a baker, the creativity of a designer, and the problem-solving mindset of a developer. Whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect UIs or building responsive, functional apps, I’m ready to turn ideas into something people can actually use — and enjoy.<br>
